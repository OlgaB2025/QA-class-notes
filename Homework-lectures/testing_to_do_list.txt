I opened the link https://todolist.james.am/#/
Font color is too faded, making the text difficult to read. 
Instruction "Double-click to edit a toodo" is hardly visible although browser zoom level is 100%. 
'Toodo' looks to be a grammar/typing mistake meant to be 'todo'.
For the moment I don't have any todos, an instruction on how to create the first one would be useful.
"What need's to be done?" in dialog box contains one more grammar mistake "needs" is the correct verbform. 
Starting to make the first task intuitively - typing in the dialog  box and pressing enter.
Started adding tasks. The amount of created tasks is being calculating starting from 0. 
Counter for the 'items' is very confusing. Firstly I thought it's an ammount of tasks left possible to be created.
Later I understood it's the amount of already created tasks. The counter starts from zero - showing the wrong amount (decreased by 1) of created tasks. 
Also, the instruction "Double-click to edit a toodo" names the tasks as 'toodo' and a counter names them 'items' - this double naming is confusing.
Pointing the cross on the right shows a card saying "TODO:REMOVE THIS EVENTUALLY" (contains text formatting mistake - space after : is required) so it calls the todo ir item 'this' which is the third naming. 
There is no dedicated space for the cross - if the row is fully typed with the text - cross overlaps todo text.
Being in a card 'All' I have marked few todos as done and accidentally pressed the arrow down in dialog box - this markes all the todos as completed and there is no opportunity to undo this click. 
Clicking the arrow one more time unmarks all the todos. 
'Completed' card doesn't reflect how many tasks are completed. 
When marking all the toddos as completed, the counter says '-1 items left'.
In DevTools I see this comment:
<!-- THIS IS A STUPID APP AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHY WE'RE WASTING OUR TIME DOING THIS DEV WORK --> this is unprofessional.
